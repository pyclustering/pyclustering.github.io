## Introduction

pyclustering is an open source Python, C++ data-mining library under General Public License 3. The library provides tools for cluster analysis, data visualization and contains oscillatory network models.

pyclustering provides Python and C++ implementation almost for each algorithm, method, etc. C++ implementation is used by default to increase performance if it is supported by target platform (Windows 32, 64 bits, Linux 32, 64 bits) otherwise Python implementation is used.

C++ part of the pyclustering library so-called ‘ccore’ is independent from python and does not uses any other third-party libraries to increase compatibility and portability. The C++ part is implemented using pure C++14 and can be easily embedded into your own project using source code or as a shared library.
